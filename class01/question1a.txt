int i, j, k = 0;

for (i = n / 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
        k = k + n / 2;
    }
}
here,  k = k + n / 2; is a constant time complexity
for outer loop (n/2)+1 or n/2 or O(n)
for inner loop it increases by 2^m for each i .Hence, m=logâ‚‚n ,the time complexity being O(logn)
So, the whole code snippets time complexity is O(nlogn).
